How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff finds the line where the two files differ

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see how my code evolve over time and learn from past mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: 1. Only commit what is necessary
    	  2. Each commit will include a message for future reference
    Cons: 1. In between commits there might be tiny changes
   	  2. You may lose power unexpectedly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    GD assumes that each doc is an independent work. Whereas Git was designed
    for programmers in mind and thus multiple files will work together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To fill later

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always revert back to one that gurantees to work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Diff this file?
